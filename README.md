# BlenderBot Chatbot with Gradio Interface

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`[Notebook Name].ipynb`) that demonstrates a chatbot built using the `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` model from the Hugging Face Transformers library and an interactive web interface created with Gradio.

## Project Description

The notebook loads the BlenderBot model, sets up a conversational pipeline, and creates a Gradio interface that allows users to chat with the chatbot. It demonstrates how to handle conversations and maintain context.

## Technologies Used

* **Hugging Face Transformers:** For loading and using the BlenderBot model (`facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill`).
* **Gradio:** For creating the interactive web interface.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Notebook:**

    * Open and run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
    * The notebook will create a Gradio interface and provide a local URL to access the chatbot.

## Notebook Structure

* `[Notebook Name].ipynb`: The main notebook containing the chatbot code.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Code Explanation

* **Model Loading:**
    * The notebook loads the `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` model using `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`.
* **Conversational Pipeline:**
    * A conversational pipeline is created using `pipeline(task="conversational", model="facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill")`.
* **Conversation Handling:**
    * The notebook demonstrates how to handle conversations and maintain context using the `Conversation` class from the transformers library.
* **Gradio Interface:**
    * A Gradio interface is created to allow users to chat with the chatbot in a web browser.

## Limitations

* The `blenderbot-400M-distill` model may not provide accurate or relevant responses in all cases.
* The chatbot may not have memory of very long conversations.
* The model can sometimes provide unrelated responses, due to the nature of the model.
* The Gradio interface is designed for local use and may require further configuration for deployment.

## Potential Improvements

* Implement more advanced conversation handling and context management.
* Fine-tune the model for specific use cases.
* Add error handling.
* Improve the Gradio interface with better styling and features.
* Explore deployment options for the Gradio app.
